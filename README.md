This project was completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [Node](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs) curriculum.

What I Learned
-----

Building a basic Node/Express app, HTTP methods (mostly GET and POST), middlewares, MVC, CRUD, relational and non-relational databases... back-end development looks fun.
